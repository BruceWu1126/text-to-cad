"""Quad-turbo 8.0 L W16 — full sectioned assembly.

Thirteen systems, each a `@memo` stage in its own file under `src/`, composed
here by CALLING them (occurrence order = the original's explode order). The
museum section is one flag, `lib/spec.py:SECTIONED`, read by every system: the
cutaway is the model's own geometry. The engine is one xbf (`XBF/w16.xbf`), holding
the `crank`, `explode` and `running_reveal` motions below; its GLB, whose clips they
are, is exported on demand (`cadgen export XBF/w16.xbf w16.glb`).
    block          block + main caps + shells
    crank          crankshaft, damper, flywheel
    pistons        16 x piston/rings/pin/circlips/rod/cap/bolts/shells
    heads          two heads
    valvetrain     64 valves + springs + retainers + followers + HLAs
    cams           four camshafts + caps
    camdrive       sprockets, chains, guides, tensioners
    covers         cam covers, coils, plug wells, breathers
    oil_system     dry-sump pan, windage tray, pumps, filter
    turbos         four turbochargers
    exhaust        16 primaries, collectors, downpipes, shields
    induction      intercoolers, plenums, throttles, charge pipes, fuel rails
    ancillaries    alternator, water pumps, belt, coolant manifolds, bell housing
